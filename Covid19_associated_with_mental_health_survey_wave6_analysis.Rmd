# BACKGROUND

In a series of national surveys, CAMH and research technology company Delvinia led research to understand the mental health and substance use impacts of COVID-19, and to track changes as the pandemic unfolded [1]. The following interactive dashboard represents selected findings based on online surveys conducted over the following intervals:

* __Wave 1__: May 8 to 12, 2020, with 1,005 respondents
* __Wave 2__: May 29 to June 1, 2020, with 1,002 respondents 
* __Wave 3__: June 19 to 23, 2020 with 1,005 respondents
* __Wave 4__: July 10 to 14, 2020 with 1,003 respondents
* __Wave 5__: September 18 to 22, 2020, with 1,003 respondents
* __Wave 6__: November 27 to December 1, 2020 with 1,003 respondents
* __Wave 7__: March 19 to 23, 2021 with 1,000 respondents
* __Wave 8__: July 9 to 13 2021, with 1,001 respondents
* __Wave 9__: January 7 to 11, 2022, with 1,004 respondents

All survey participants were English-speaking Canadians ages 18 and older [1].

__Below are some key findings for this particular study, wave 6.__

Data source: [CAMH Studies Mental Health over Coronavirus Pandemic](https://www.delvinia.com/camh-coronavirus-mental-health/)

# OBJECTIVES

In this report, I employ the different packages in R and various functions to generate firstly the initial analysis of the data, and second the subsequent steps to prepare data for analysis. I use the the dataset provided by the 6th wave of the CAMH study to generate insights regarding:

* The dataset itself
* The study's research results


# METHODOLOGY - SELECT THE DATA

In this report, I use RStudio to scrutinize the data and generate descriptive analyses using relevant packages. Some of the packages that I use and their functions are:

1. `r colorize("__dplyr__", "blue")`: A powerful and efficient data manipulation package that provides a set of tools for filtering, grouping, and summarizing data. It is particularly useful for working with large datasets and is widely used in data wrangling tasks.

2. `r colorize("__ggplot2__", "blue")`: A data visualization package that provides a flexible and powerful way to create a wide range of static and interactive plots. It is widely used for creating high-quality data visualizations and is particularly useful for exploratory data analysis.

3. `r colorize("__pacman__", "blue")`: An R package management tool, which provides a convenient way to install and manage R packages, similar to the package manager on Linux and MacOS. It is a wrapper around the basic functionality provided by the "install.packages()" function and provides a more user-friendly interface for installing, updating, and removing packages.

## Import the dataset and the datamap
The data and the datamap for CAMH study wave 6th were imported.

```{r "import dataset and datamap from cloud"}
camh <- read.csv("http://bus-sawtooth.mcmaster.ca/eH705_BLENDED_W2020/CAMH_wave6_nl.csv")
camh_dm <- read.csv("http://bus-sawtooth.mcmaster.ca/eH705_BLENDED_W2020/camh_Q.csv")
```

```{r Table1}
kable(camh_dm, caption = "The datamap of the survey") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F, position = "left", fixed_thead = T) %>%
  scroll_box(width = "800px", height = "500px")

```

## Trim and filter only important variables

```{r "overview structure of the given dataframe", inlcude = TRUE, echo=TRUE, results='hide'}
str(camh)
view(camh)
```

A brief overview shows that there are __1003 observations of 66 variables__ in this dataframe. I will limit my work to the following __17 variables__ only:

* hAge ( Age_group),
* Gender (male, female, other),
* Q4_1, Q4_3, Q4_5,
* Q5 (switch coding 1->4, 2->3, 3->2, 4->1),
* Q8x1 - Q8x3,
* Q15,
* Q17,
* Q20x1, Q20x2, Q20x3,
* Q25 Education
* Q26 Marital status
* Q27 Ethnicity/Race

```{r Table2}
camh_select <- camh %>% select(Age_group, 
                               Gender, 
                               Q4_1_me_covid_test_pos, 
                               Q4_3_me_covid_symptoms_no_test, 
                               Q4_5_me_covid_test_neg, 
                               Q5_fin_worry,
                               Q8x1_nervous_frq, 
                               Q8x2_not_stop_worry_frq, 
                               Q8x3_worry_diff_frq, 
                               Q15_alcohol, 
                               Q17_alcohol_frq, 
                               Q20x1_depressed_frq, 
                               Q20x2_lonely_frq, 
                               Q20x3_hopeful_frq, 
                               Q25_Education, 
                               Q26_marital, 
                               Q27_race)

head(camh_select) %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "New dataframe of only 17 variables of interest") %>%
  kable_classic() %>%
  scroll_box(width = "800px", height = "300px")
```

I switched coding for Q5 - "How worried are you about the impact of COVID-19 on your personal financial situation?" as per instruction (switch coding 1->4, 2->3, 3->2, 4->1). 

```{r Table3}
camh_new = camh_select %>% mutate(Q5_fin_worry=recode(Q5_fin_worry, '1' = 4, '2' = 3, '3' = 2, '4' = 1))

head(camh_new)%>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "New dataframe of switched codes") %>%
  kable_classic()  %>%
  scroll_box(width = "800px", height = "300px")
```
## Renaming the variables

I also rename the variable in this new dataframe to enhance clarity and comprehensiveness. 

```{r Table4}
colnames(camh_new) <- c("age_group",
                        "gender",
                        "covid_positive",
                        "covid_no_test",
                        "covid_test_negative",
                        "financial_worry",
                        "nervous_frq",
                        "not_stop_worry_frq",
                        "worry_diff_frq",
                        "alcohol_drink",
                        "alcohol_frq",
                        "depressed_frq",
                        "lonely_frq",
                        "hopeful_frq",
                        "education",
                        "marital",
                        "race")
head(camh_new) %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "New dataframe of selected variables renamed") %>%
    kable_classic()  %>%
  scroll_box(width = "800px", height = "300px")
```

# FINDINGS

## Findings - Observations from srutinizing the data

Now the data is prepared, I carry on to examine the data, identify any missing values, or any errors in the collected data.

```{r Table5}
knitr::kable(describe(camh_new), caption = "Summary statistic of the dataframe") %>%
  kable_classic_2()
```

```{r Table6}
camh_new_ano <- anomalies(camh_new)
knitr::kable(camh_new_ano$variables, caption = "The structure of the missing values") %>%
  kable_classic_2()
```

```{r Figure1, fig.cap= "Plot frequencies of the variables in the dataset", fig.height = 20, fig.width = 30}
#create an empty list
plots <- list()

#create loops
for (i in colnames(camh_new)){
  value <- camh_new[[i]]
  variable_plot <- plot_frq(value) + labs(x = i)
  plots[[i]] <- variable_plot
}

#arrange the plots together
multiplot(plotlist = plots, cols = 5, layout = NULL)
```

Observations on scrutinizing the data:

* `r colorize("__There is no N/A value in the dataframe of interest__", "red")`
* For Q15_alcohol, "0" which can be an anomalous value in other dataset, for this partcicular case, the value is use to distinct the "non_alcohol" drinkers from "alcohol" drinkers but did not consume alcohol within the 7 days of the survey. 
* For some variables, existing extreme values like "95","96", and "99" which skew the distribution and affecting the mean values (Such as Q15 and Q17 regarding the alcohol consumption).
* For other variables in this dataframe, they are __categorical__, which means the value is limited and usually based on a particular finite group. However, for __"Q15- During the PAST 7 DAYS, on how many days did you drink ALCOHOL?"__, there are both __continuous values__ (The number of days people drinking) and the __categorical values__ ("I do not drink alcohol" and "Prefer not to answer"). 
* Therefore, for question __"Q15- During the PAST 7 DAYS, on how many days did you drink ALCOHOL?"__, there are three groups of respondents:
  1. _People who drink alcohol_ (Corresponding to answer from 0 - 7)
  2. _People who do NOT drink alcohol_ (Corresponding to answer 99 - "I do not drink alcohol")
  3. _People who choose not to answer the question_ (Corresponding to answer 96 - Prefer not to answer")
* So I will break Q15 into 3 categories accordingly. And within the first category, I will maintain the numeric values for further analysis. The third category, I identify it as `r colorize("__not applicable or n/a__", "red")` and thus, will proceed to remove them. 
* The rest of the data was fine

## Findings - missing values

### Remove n/a values

I change value "96" from Q15 into ___n/a___ and remove those ___n/a___ entries from the dataframe. 
This is only to demonstrate how to remove n/a from a dataset. Otherwise can use the subset() function to remove entries associated with the "96" value.

The new data frame from now will be referred to as "camh_clean". Now there is only `r colorize("__999 observations__","blue")`

```{r Table7}
camh_clean <- camh_new

camh_clean$alcohol_drink[camh_clean$alcohol_drink == 96] <- NA
camh_clean <- na.omit(camh_clean)

kable(frq(camh_clean$alcohol_drink, out = "t"), caption = "Removing n/a values") %>%
  kable_classic() %>% kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)
```

### Remove unnecessary data

For some questions, there are the "Preferred not to answer" option, which coded by "96"; as well as "Not sure" coded by "97", and they occupy less than 5% of the total observations. Therefore, I will remove observations that have a value of "96" and "97" to make the data more relevant.

Now there is only `r colorize("__954 observations__","blue")`

```{r Table8}
camh_clean2 <- subset(camh_clean, !rowSums(camh_clean == 96))
camh_clean2 <- filter(camh_clean2, !rowSums(camh_clean2 == 97))
#an example: 
kable(frq(camh_clean2$race, out = "t"), caption = "Removing unnecessary data") %>%
  kable_classic() %>% kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)
```


## Findings - Recoding

Data in the "camh_new" dataframe will be recoded, following the instructions in the new datamap, "20-3082-DATAMAP.xlsx".

### Recode Demographic variables

Demographic variables will be decoded directly (without creating the factor forms, as we do not need their numeric values for calculation) such as:

* Age groups
* Genders
* Covid status (Variable 3 -5)
* Education level
* Marital status
* Race/ Ethnicity

```{r Table9}
camh_label = camh_clean2 %>%

### Recode Non-Demographic variables

Non-demographic variables will be decoded by creating a factor forms, namely:

* Financial worry
* Nervous frequency
* Not stop worry frequency
* Worry different things frequency
* Alcohol consumption frequency
* Depressed frequency
* Lonely frequency
* Hopeful frequency

### Recode Q15 into 2 categories "Drinking" and "No drinking"

Values in question 15 will be re-coded into 2 different categories:

1. ___People who drink alcohol___ (Corresponding to answer from 0 - 7)
2. ___People who do NOT drink alcohol___ (Corresponding to answer 99 - "I do not drink alcohol")

From Table \@ref(tab:Table12), Table \@ref(tab:Table13), and Figure \@ref(fig:Figure2) above, we can see that the majority of people took part in this survey were not COVID-19, be it asymptomatic or have been tested. There are people with confirmed COVID-19 infection, but their number is too small to be accounted for, at __6 people over the total of 954 responses__.

In terms of __genders__, there is an equal number of males and females taking part in this survey, with the latter group (483) is a slightly more than the former one (459). The third group of "Other" gender made up a humble statistic of 6 people.

In terms of __age groups__, the youngest group of respondents who are from 18 to 39 years old was significantly larger than the other two groups, with a gap as wide as 100 respondents, making up approximately 20% - 25% of the total people in each group. This may be owing to the fact that young adults are more technical savvy than their older counterparts, thus they have a greater tendency to engage in online surveys and studies similar to the CAMH research. However, it still requires further analysis to determine whether or not this difference carries any significance.

### Investigating the difference between the drinking and not drinking groups

* Investigating into the population who drink from the responses, we can see that the majority of people who participated in this survey drink alcohol. 
* Nevertheless, it is interesting to see that the number of males and females in each drinking and not drinking group is not significantly different.
* Among people who drink, the average days on drinking in the past 7 days before taking the survey is ___mean(x)=1.99___. 
* The majority of people reported that they do not drink more or less within the past 7 days, but a considerable number of people recalled to drink a slightly more during the same period. 
* Females are observed to have the tendency to be nervous and worried more than their male counterparts.

### The association of _Binge drinking_ and stress level in respondents

* A closer look into people who did not drink during the past 7 days and who drank every day regarding their stress frequency
* Overall, there is no significant difference between the two groups from observing the graphs
* Nonetheless, the number of people who experienced nervousness and worries for several days in the binge-drinking group accounted for the largest group. 
* In contrast, for people who did not drink, they appeared to do not experience any episodes of anxiety
* From the graphs, people who binge_drinking might experience longer periods of stress than people who did not drink alcohol. However, more investigation is still needed to make the association of _Binge drinking_ and stress level in respondents clearer

# CONCLUSION

In conclusion, I would like to summarize my process for this analytic report:

1. I studied the data, the datamap, and filtered the 17 variables of interest
2. I evaluated n/a and anomalous values, weighing their impact against the value of the data set and subsequent analysis. For example, I maintained the value of 99 as "Not drinking" and used it for analysis. On the other hand, I removed values corresponding to option "Preferred not to answer" as they would not contribute to insights
3. I recoded the values using different methods - the factor form and the direct recoding - with respect to their nature, demographic or non-demographic values
4. I used different approaches - tables and graphs - to generate insights from the data set
5. Summary of findings:
  
    * There are only 6 cases of COVID-19 positive out of 954 observations, making around 0.6% of the population studied
    * There are equal numbers of male and female respondents
    * The larger group of respondents is the youngest group of people from 18 to 39 years old
    * Respondents who drink, reported to drink an average of 2 days during the past 7 days before taking the survey
    * Females showed considerable tendencies to experience nervousness and worries more frequent than males. However, the relationship between this mental issues and COVID-19 need more investigation
    * There is no significant difference between people who did not drink during the past 7 days and people who binged drinking the same period of time
    * People who binged drinking might experience more prolonged nervous episodes but more investigation required before coming to a definitive conclusion
